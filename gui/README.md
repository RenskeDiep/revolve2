## 1) Using the GUI.

This GUI is a very new addition to revolve, its goal is to bundle up some of the functionalities of our robot evolution system and allow for easy parametrization of evolutionary runs.

- To use the GUI simply navigate to the "gui/viewer/" folder 
- Then run the **main_window.py** file from your terminal: python main_window.py


Note: This is still very much under development, a lot of the planned features do not do anything yet (this will be indicated by the GUI).  created by √Åron Ferencz, if you have any issues or ideas you can reach me at the following email address: a.r.ferencz@student.vu.nl
